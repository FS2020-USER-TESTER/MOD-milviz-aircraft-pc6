### FS2024 will reset to default all of your previously customized control assignments for the 6 models when MOD is loaded.
Go into controls menu to re-select your desired control profiles.

Here are issues this mod addresses:

* [Standard Wheel Models]  Fix to "right wheel appears to be floading when parked."
* [All 6 models] Correct AP configuration to match KAP140 specification - when AP enabled go to ROLL mode.
* [All 6 models]  Increase transfer pump rate from 0.03 to 0.1 lbs/sec.
* [3 Analog Models] Correct operation of AMP gauge - negative with battery only and positive when generator operating.
* [3 Analog Models] Correction to "Fuel gauges should not operate when no main bus voltage."
* [3 Analog Models] Correct ITT digital/analog gauge.
* [2 Wheel Models] Correct tablet to allow tie-down when parked. Tie-down not provided in float or tundra


## Suggest you make comments and suggestions in the github Issues tab and not to Milviz Discord.

KNOWN OPEN ISSUES

* [Glass Models] Not using latest G1000 code version
* [All] When spawning on runway, ignition switch is on and guard is up. Guard on starter is also up.
* [Analog Models] Lettering of Red annunicators not readable

Should work in FS2020 but not much tested.
